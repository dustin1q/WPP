# Performance Patterns for  Web Dev

This repo focusses on and demonstrates performant coding patterns and UI examples needed for common frontend development solutions.  
Focuss areas include:
* Simplifying Layouts
* Asset Loading Strategies
* Native UI Web Components 

## To Do
* Update nav
* Add and use SVG icons
* Leverage Livecode in a code sample template 
    * Use Native UI items in this template
    * Abstract examples into a data object
* Add Unit Testing
* Incorporate React component (create React App)
* Consider Modual Federation Pattern

## Architecture
This project uses Astro as a primary templating engine and static site generator. It may evolve to incorporate React and adition libraries. The aim in adding additional libraries will be to qualify and demonstrate multipal library support, and hopfully Modual Federation design patterns.
