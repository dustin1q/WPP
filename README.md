## Architecture
This project uses Astro as a primary templating engine and static site generator. Within Astro, content is managed using markdown files (.md) and Astro's content collections feature. .md files follow a typed formate as seen in the frontmatter. 

For code sample templates, custom <html-code> <css-code> and <js-code> tages are accepted to render and showcase languages within each code sample. 

Monaco Editor is used as a code editor library wihin the CodeEditor component. This Library is delivered in React and used Astros Island patterns to render on a given template or page.
