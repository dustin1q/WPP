# Wen Performance Playground for Web Dev

This repo focusses on and demonstrates performant coding patterns and UI examples needed for common frontend development solutions.  
Focus areas include:
* Simplifying Layouts
* Asset Loading Strategies
* Native UI Web Components
* Emerging and lesser-known CSS techniques 

## Next steps:

1. Add and use SVG icons
1. Add Unit Testing
1. Consider a Modual Federation Pattern to demonstrate

## Architecture
This project uses Astro as a primary templating engine and static site generator. Within Astro, content is managed using markdown files (.md) and Astro's content collections feature. .md files follow a typed formate as seen in the frontmatter. 

For code sample templates, custom <html-code> <css-code> and <js-code> tages are accepted to render and showcase languages within each code sample. 

Monaco Editor is used as a code editor library wihin the CodeEditor component. This Library is delivered in React and used Astros Island patterns to render on a given template or page.
